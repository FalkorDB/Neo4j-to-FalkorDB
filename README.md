# Neo4j to FalkorDB migration (without APOC)

Migrating graph database contents from one property graph solution to another is a common task.\
In this example, we use stardard cypher queries to extract data from a sample graph example availble in neo4j namely "Movies",\
allow transformation of labels and properties, and as a next step load the csv files one by one into falkor db.\
Please note that you can use any source neo4j dataset, and the process migrates nodes, edges, constraints and indexes.

## Step 1: Setting up neo4j 
Follow neo4j documentation to setup a locally run neo4j database: 
https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/installation/

## Step 2: Loading the movies sample graph data to neo4j
You can load the movies dataset by following the ":guide movies" command in the neo4j browser.
More details are available here: https://neo4j.com/docs/getting-started/appendix/example-data/

## Step 3: Reviewing and updating mapping configuration file
The configuration file migrate_config.json allows you to modify how the labels and properties are represented in FalkorDB.
In order to extract the ontology (for a dataset which is not the movies sample dataset),\
you may generate a template config file using this command:
```bash
python3 neo4j_to_csv_extractor.py --password <your-neo4j-password> --generate-template <your-template>.json --analyze-only
```

Sample output of the ontology extraction phase is shown below as executed against the movies dataset

## Step 4: Extracting data from neo4j and generating csv files
To extract data from neo4j you can activate the relevant python script:
```bash
python3 neo4j_to_csv_extractor.py --password <your-neo4j-password> --config migrate_config.json
```
The script would read data from neo4j and create in csv_output subfolder all nodes and edges csv files
with headers and content adapted based on guidelines in the migrate_config.json file

## Step 5: Loading csv data into falkordb
Setup falkordb on your local machine (you can either select the "server" option only, \
or use standard deployment that includes the browser component:
https://docs.falkordb.com/getting_started.html
After setup you will have falkordb data conntection at port 6379 and web browser at port 3000
```bash
python3 falkordb_csv_loader.py MOVIES --port 6379 --stats
```
Note: In case your FalkorDB connection is secured with username and password you can add them according to the syntax described below. You may also control the batch size used per loaded CSV file.
```bash
usage: falkordb_csv_loader.py [-h] [--host HOST] [--port PORT] [--username USERNAME] [--password PASSWORD] [--batch-size BATCH_SIZE] [--stats] [--csv-dir CSV_DIR]
                              [--merge-mode]
                              graph_name

Load CSV files into FalkorDB

positional arguments:
  graph_name            Target graph name in FalkorDB

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --host HOST           FalkorDB host
  --port PORT           FalkorDB port
  --username USERNAME   FalkorDB username (optional)
  --password PASSWORD   FalkorDB password (optional)
  --batch-size BATCH_SIZE
                        Batch size for loading (default: 5000)
  --stats               Show graph statistics after loading
  --csv-dir CSV_DIR     Directory containing CSV files (default: csv_output)
  --merge-mode          Use MERGE instead of CREATE for upsert behavior

```
